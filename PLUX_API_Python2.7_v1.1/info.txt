This system works with input from EMG signals which outputted by Biosignals sensors. 
The signals can't be immediately inputted, because it still 
in a form of raw data and need to be processed to extract the
features from data signal into numeric data. 
The process is called 'Feature Extraction'. 
There are 4 Features that system use from the signals such as Max Amplitude, 
Min Amplitude, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), and Wavelength. 

After all the features has been extracted, next step is input the features into the systems 
to be classified as click. Classification systems 
can be choosed between two methods, KNN and SVM. 
Finally the click classification result (left / right) 
will be executed by systems into actual mouse clicks.
