This system works with input of EMG signals which outputed by Biosignals sensors.
The signals can't be immidiately inputed, because it still being raw data.
Data need to be processed to extract the feature from data signal into numeric data.
That process we call it 'Feature Extraction'. There is 4 Features that system use from the signals
there is Max Amplitude, Min Amplitude, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), and Wavelength. 

After all the feature extracted, next step is input the features into the systems to be classified as click.
Classification systems can be choosen between two methods, that is KNN and SVM. Then finally
the click classification result (left / right) will be executed by systems into actual mouse clicks.
